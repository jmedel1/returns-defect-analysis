# Bulk Returns Defect Analysis (Mock Project)

This project uses Excel to track and analyze common return defects for large bulk items like furniture. Itâ€™s based on real workflows from my Amazon fulfillment center and was created to help build practical skills for a data analyst role in ICQA or Quality.

## What's Included

- Sample data for 30+ returns including:
  - Product names (e.g., sofas, treadmills)
  - Defect types like Damaged or Missing Parts
  - Item counts and resolution times
- A calculated column for **Minutes Per Item**
- PivotTables to break down:
  - Defects by type
  - Resolution time by product
- Charts to help visualize trends

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, bar charts, formulas)

## Why I Made This

I created this as a self-learning project while preparing to apply for an internal analyst position at Amazon. It helped me practice using Excel to find trends and present useful insights from operations data.
